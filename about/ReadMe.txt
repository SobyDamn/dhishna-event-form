This folder contains different screenshots showing how the form works!
image will be uploaded to firebase storage and input data to firebase db.
Few stuffs that needs to be fixed
-Upload Image button
it does nothing, but image will be uploaded to firebase storage as file is selected. 
Better idea is to add progress bar
-Save image name or url in database would be easier to find the inage uploaded by user.
